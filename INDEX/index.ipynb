    "1. Use Fibonacci patterns to visualize the learnt material:\n",
    "\n",

Some sophisticated plants have been identified to show growth pattern that goes in congruence with golden ratio (this is directly related to fibonacci sequence). The idea is to add new information in a chunk that is in a golden ratio with existing information that we are building upon.\n",
